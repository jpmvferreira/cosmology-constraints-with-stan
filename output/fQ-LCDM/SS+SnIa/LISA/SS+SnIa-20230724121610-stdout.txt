Exception: Error in function tanh_sinh<double>::integrate: The tanh_sinh quadrature evaluated your function at a singular point and got -nan. Please narrow the bounds of integration or check your function for singularities. (in '/home/undercover/teaching/internships/ia/2022-23/Code/model/fQ-LCDM/SS+SnIa.stan', line 51, column 4 to column 117)
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
